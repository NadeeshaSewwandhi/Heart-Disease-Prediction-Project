# Heart Disease Prediction Project
# Introduction
#### This project is a heart disease prediction system developed using machine learning techniques. The system aims to assist healthcare professionals in predicting the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on a variety of medical attributes.

# Features
### Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and prepares it for modeling.
### Feature Extraction: Identifies and selects the most relevant features from the dataset.
### Model Training: Uses Logistic Regression for binary classification.
### Performance Evaluation: Evaluates model accuracy using training and test data.
### Prediction System: Predicts the presence or absence of heart disease for new patient data.

# How It Works
### Import Libraries:
#### Utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for machine learning.

### Data Collection and Processing:
#### Reads the heart disease dataset, checks for missing values, and generates descriptive statistics.

### Splitting the Dataset: 
#### Divides the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

### Training the Model: 
#### Initializes and trains a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
### Evaluating Performance: 
#### Calculates accuracy scores for both the training and testing data to assess the model's performance.

### Building a Prediction System:
#### Uses the trained model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on new patient data.

# Technologies Used
#### Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
#### NumPy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
#### pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
#### scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
#### Logistic Regression: The statistical method used for binary classification in this project.
